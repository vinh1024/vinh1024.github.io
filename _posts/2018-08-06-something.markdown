# The second pót
## Preface to the First Edition
C is a general-purpose programming language which features economy of
expression, modern control flow and data structures, and a rich set of operators.
C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized to
any particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its gen-
erality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly
more powerful languages.
C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating sys-
tem on the DEC PDP-11, by Dennis Ritchie. The operating system, the C com·
piler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs (including all of the
software used to prepare this book) are written in C. Production compilers also
exist for several other machines, including the IBM System/370, the Honeywell
6000, and the Interdata 8/32. C is not tied to any particular hardware or sys-
tem, however, and it is easy to write programs that will run without change on
any machine that supports C.
This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C. It con-
tains a tutorial introduction to get new users started as soon as possible,
separate chapters on each major feature, and a reference manual. Most of the
treatment is based on reading, writing and revising examples, rather than on
mere statements of rules. For the most part, the examples are complete, real
programs, rather than isolated fragments. All examples have been tested
directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form. Besides showing how
to make effective use of the language, we have also tried where possible to illus-
trate useful algorithms and principles of good style and sound design.
The book is not an introductory programming manual; it assumes some fam-
iliarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements,
loops, and functions. Nonetheless, a novice programmer should be able to read
along and pick up the language, although access to a more knowledgeable col-
league will help.
In our experience, C has proven to be a pleasant, expressive, and versatile
language for a wide variety of programs. It is easy to learn, and it wears well
as one's experience with it grows. We hope that this book will help you to use it
well.

have added greatly to this book and to our pleasure in writing it. In particular,
Mike Bianchi, Jim Blue, Stu Feldman, Doug Mcilroy, Bill Roome, Bob Rosin,
and Larry Rosier all read multiple versions with care. We are also indebted to
AI Abo, Steve Bourne, Dan Dvorak, Chuck Haley, Debbie Haley, Marion
Harris, Rick Holt, Steve Johnson, John Mashey, Bob Mitze, Ralph Muha, Peter
Nelson, Elliot Pinson, Bill Plauger, Jerry Spivack, Ken Thompson, and Peter
Weinberger for helpful comments at various stages, and to Mike Lesk and Joe
Ossanna for invaluable assistance with typesetting.
